1.	You are asked to create a directory with PowerShell named. ‘C:\mydir’

2.	Now you have to create two text files in there with PowerShell named 1.txt and 2.txt. These can be empty.

3.	Now you have to create two .jpg files in there with PowerShell named 1.jpg and 2.jpg. Doesn’t have to be an actual picture.

4.	Remove all the files 1.txt,2.txt,1.jpg and 2.jpg in a one liner using the pipeline. So you have to use one line, using a pipeline if you can

Do 2 and 3 again

5.	Now with a one-liner remove the text files with the property extension (.txt) , so all the .txt files from the ‘C:\MyDir’ directory, leaving the two ‘.jpg’ 1.jpg and 2.jpg files intact! (Not removing C:\MyDir)

 (remember, you have to filter on a property! Remember the Cmdlet and remember how to find out, which property could do it !)

All in the name of science… sorry again but restore 1.txt and 2.txt in other words create them again in the ‘C:\MyDir’ directory 

6.	Now with a one-liner move (not remove) the text files with the property extension (.txt) , so all the .txt files from the ‘C:\MyDir’ directory, leaving the two ‘.jpg’ 1.jpg and 2.jpg files intact to a new directory called ‘C:\Moved’

7.	Now for something completely different… Create 4 local users. User1 and User2 will have the description ‘sales’. User3 and User4 will have the description ‘support’.

8.	Your boss wants you to disable the sales users and change their description into ‘disabled’ (This can be tricky!!)

######################################################
9.	Retrieve all the processes on your screen with a handle count less than 100. (This is tricky, try looking up how to say ‘less than’ in PowerShell).

1:  New-Item -Path . -Name "MyDir" -ItemType "directory"

2: New-Item -Path . -Name "1.txt" -ItemType "file", New-Item -Path . -Name "2.txt" -ItemType "file"

3: New-Item -Path . -Name "1.jpg" -ItemType "file", New-Item -Path . -Name "2.jpg" -ItemType "file"

4: Get-ChildItem . | Remove-Item

5: Get-ChildItem | Where-Object {$PSItem.Extension -eq ".txt"} | Remove-Item

6: First, create destionation: New-Item -Path .. -Name "Moved" -ItemType "directory", Then move: Get-ChildItem | Where-Object {$PSItem.Extension -eq ".txt"} | Move-Item -Destination "..\Moved"

7: New-LocalUser -Name "User1" -NoPassword -Description "Sales", New-LocalUser -Name "User2" -NoPassword -Description "Sales", New-LocalUser -Name "User3" -NoPassword -Description "Support", New-LocalUser -Name "User4" -NoPassword -Description "Support"

8: First: Get-LocalUser | Where-Object {$PSItem.description -eq "Sales"} | Disable-LocalUser, then Get-LocalUser | Where-Object {$PSItem.description -eq "Sales"} | Set-LocalUser -Description "Disabled"

9:  Get-Process | Where-Object {$_.HandleCount -lt 100}
